Welcome to the Keylogger and File Hider repository! This collection of scripts allows you to log key events and hide files. The keylogger is powered by the keyboard library in Python, and the logs are saved to logs.txt. The file hider script is written in VBScript and can hide files like a pro.
File Descriptions

    Keylogger.py: Python script for logging key events using the keyboard library.
    LauncherForWindows.bat: Batch file for installing/upgrading pip, installing required packages, and running Keylogger.py.
    requirements.txt: Text file listing the required Python packages for the keylogger.
    file_hider.vbs: VBScript file for hiding files listed in the filesToHide array.

Installation and Usage

    Clone this repository to your local machine.
    Run LauncherForWindows.bat to install/upgrade pip, install required packages, and run the keylogger.
    Key events will be logged to logs.txt in the same directory.
    The file_hider.vbs script will hide the files listed in the filesToHide array.

Warning: These scripts are for educational and ethical purposes only. Use them responsibly and always comply with applicable laws and regulations. Stay stealthy, my friend!

NOTE: Most of the coding in these projects was done by an AI, Secondly I suggest that you DO NOT CHANGE THE NAME OF FILES unless you know what you are doing and you are going to change the name of those files from the code of other files as well. (Sorry im a newbie & i couldnt find a solution to this problem)
